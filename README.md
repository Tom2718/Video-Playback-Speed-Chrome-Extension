# Video Playback Speed

A very simple extension that allows the user to change the playback speed of a video.

* Ultra lightweight and very simple. 
* Open source code.
* Change playback speed to any number.
* Easy 'up' and 'down' controls.

Permissions: The extension requires access to the current tab so that it can change the speed. It will say it has access to all websites but only runs when opened. You can also verify the source code.
